# Advanced algorithms concepts

## Data Structures
* Array
* Linked list
* Queue
* Stack

## Searching algorithms
* Dichotomy
* Linear

## Sorting algorithms
* Bubble sort
* Inserting sort


One other **key concept** to learn is about **time complexity** (duration execution of a program) and **space complexity** (memory usage of a program) that relies partly on the concepts listed above.

These complexities use the "[Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)".
